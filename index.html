    <h1>Entropy</h1>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Entropy is a programming language about giving up control. All data decays as the program runs: each value alters slightly every time it's used, becoming less precise. An Entropy programmer needs to abandon the pursuit of precision which most programming demands—often working against years of habit—in order to program effectively. Any output from an Entropy program will be approximate, and the more the data is accessed, the more random it will become. The programmer has, at best, a short window to get his/her idea across before the program corrodes.</p>

    <p>Take for example a simple 99 bottles of beer on the wall program:</p>

    <div id="slider">
        <div id="thumb">
            <div id="label"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="line"></div>

        <p>[Entropy] was inspired by the glitch aesthetic ... and by esolangs in the tradition of brainfuck, which twist logic into delicious nonsense.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Entropy addresses the compulsive thinking reinforced by programming, the rigidity of logic, and the way we must compromise with the computer in order to get it to understand us. It is something that has become more familiar to non-programmers as people manage more of their social interactions and other messy human stuff through computers.</p>
